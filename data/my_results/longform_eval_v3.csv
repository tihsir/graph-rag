q1_hla_psoriasis,Explain the relationship between HLA-B gene variants and autoimmune diseases like psoriasis. What mechanisms link genetic variation to disease manifestation?,9.75,"{'self_verified': True, 'context_length': 4004}",10.0,"{'self_verified': True, 'context_length': 7035}",9.5,"{'extraction_mode': 'separate', 'kg_triples': 76, 'semantic_triples': 67, 'merged_triples': 143, 'duplicates_found': 0, 'dedup_reasoning': ""After careful analysis, no triples from the KG set express the same relationship with the same entities as the triples in the SEM set. The KG triples relate autoimmune diseases to specific genes, while the SEM triples associate pairs of rsIDs (SNPs) with psoriasis. There are no matching entity pairs or relationships to consider as duplicates, even when reversing the order of subject and object for the 'ASSOCIATES_WITH' relationship."", 'self_verified': True}"
